Cargo is a useful tool in the Rust universe, with no equivalent in the
OCaml world in one tool. We have no news of `bob`, the tool supposed
to be developed by OCamllabs.

We need first to check existing tools that could be competitors,
partners or sources of inspiration:
* cargo
* opam-publish
* dune-release: Ã  voir
* topkg
* duniverse

Some names for the tool:
* caravan
* ograc
* drom (that we chose for now)
* ocar
* check the Saga "Les Hordes du Outrevent"

Discussions:
* Is drom just a wrapper on top of opam and dune ? probably more than that
* What would the user start with ? Cargo comes pre-installed and working with
  the Rust compiler, but OCaml is not installed with `drom`. So, with `drom`,
  we need:
  * to have `opam` and `dune` already present (we could do a single binary with
    the three of them)
  * to have an OCaml switch: this could be done by `drom init`. Building
    OCaml in every project is just too expensive. Maybe we could use binary
    packages. It won't work on all archs. Maybe we could share a global switch,
    to build OCaml only once, and then share it with local switches as
    what is currently done for the system switch. This could be done by
    sharing the paths, and then using `opam install --fake` dor all shared
    packages. By default, `drom init` would try to use binary packages,
    unless the user use `--no-binary`.
* It would be nice for `drom` to become the single entry point to multiple
   tools to work with a project: `opam`, `dune`, `merlin`, `ocamlformat`,
   management of headers, scafolding, etc.
